# WELCOME TO SV_MAZE_RUNNER

## Overview

*This repository houses the code and information of our Digital Systems final project. This code utilizes the DE-10 Lite board as a game controller for a labyrinth navigation game. The game contains three levels which gradually increase in difficulty. The user is challenged to keep their board stable enough to navigate through the mazes.*
